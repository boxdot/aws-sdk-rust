//! <p>Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor is a fully managed service that you can use
//! to customize a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enterprisebilling/6b7c01c5-b592-467e-9769-90052eaf359c/userguide/understanding-eb.html#eb-other-definitions">pro forma</a> version of your billing data each month, to accurately show or chargeback
//! your end customers. Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor doesn't change the way
//! you're billed by Amazon Web Services each month by design. Instead, it provides you with a
//! mechanism to configure, generate, and display rates to certain customers over a given billing
//! period. You can also analyze the difference between the rates you apply to your accounting
//! groupings relative to your actual rates from Amazon Web Services. As a result of your Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor configuration, the payer account can also see the
//! custom rate applied on the billing details page of the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing">Amazon Web Services Billing console</a>, or configure a cost and usage report per
//! billing group.</p>
//! <p>This documentation shows how you can configure Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor using its
//! API. For more information about using the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/enterprisebilling/">Amazon Web Services
//! Billing Conductor</a> user interface, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enterprisebilling/6b7c01c5-b592-467e-9769-90052eaf359c/userguide/what-is-enterprisebilling.html"> Amazon Web Services Enterprise
//! Billing Console User Guide</a>.</p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
